    <summary class="glow-title">Backstory</summary>
    <p>Brutus was born beneath the shimmering auroras of the northern sky, a sign among the Star Sky Clan that a child is touched by ancestral strength. The Star Sky Clan, a proud people of bearfolk, live in balance with the wild—guardians of the tundra, keepers of old ways, and masters of brutal, primal combat passed down through blood and bone.

Brutus was always strong, but not just in muscle. He had a quick mind and an instinctive understanding of combat that couldn't be taught. His uncle, Gorran the Claw, a revered monster hunter and clan champion, recognized this and trained him in the ancient style of the brawler—using body, momentum, and surroundings to turn anything into a weapon. Claws, fists, broken bone, or rock—Brutus learned to fight with what was at hand and win with heart.

Years ago, Gorran embarked on a final, fabled hunt to the The Wilds—a place where only the fiercest predators and boldest hunters roam. He never returned.

The clan mourned, but Brutus could not accept silence as an answer. Now bearing the clan's stone-ringed arm bracers—symbols of his right to fight in Gorran’s place—Brutus sails to the island. He seeks answers. He seeks Gorran. And if the island swallowed his uncle, then Brutus will tear through tooth and shadow until he finds what lies at the heart of the hunt.

Personality Traits:
Pragmatic Fighter: Brutus trusts fists over fancy weapons and never backs down from a test of strength.

Loyal to Kin: He will do anything to protect the memory and honor of his clan and his uncle.

Wary of Magic: He respects spiritual power, but trusts the physical world more than words and illusions.

Brawler Flavor Additions:
Wears bone-and-hide wraps carved with clan runes—"when blood is spilled, the runes warm."

Fights with bear-like grapples, mauls, and slams—his style is raw, instinctive, and brutal.

Can use improvised weapons: cracked tusks, broken chains, monster bones from fallen foes.</p>
